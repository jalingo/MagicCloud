    ///     - receiver: This is the instance of the associated `MCMirrorAbstraction` and may be interacted with during error resolution.

    ///     - conflictingResolutionPolicy: The conflict resolution policy for error handling to follow.

    ///     - ignoreUnknownItemCustomAction: When not nil, this closure will be executed if an unknown item situation occurs. If set, `ignoreUnknownItem` will be treated as true, regardless of passed argument.
