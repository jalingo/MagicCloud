    /// This generic method is associated with a type conforming to `MCMirrorAbstraction` protocol, and handles any cloud error passed along with environmental variables and configurations.

    /// - Parameters:
    ///     - error: The cloud error that needs to be resolved.
    ///     - op: The operation that generated the error, and (if needed) this operation will be copied and relaunched.
    ///     - recordables: This array contains the recordables that were being manipulated when the error occured. Use an empty array if fetching or querying when operation failed.
    ///     - receiver: This is the instance of the associated `MCMirrorAbstraction` and may be interacted with during error resolution.
    ///     - database: This argument enumerates the scope of the database being interacted with when error was thrown.
    ///     - whileIgnoringUnknownItem: When true, the method will disregard errors that resulted from an expected record being found. This would be useful if making a query where there may or may not be results. If false, unknown item situations will be resolved normally.
    ///     - ignoreUnknownAction: When not nil, this closure will be executed if an unknown item situation occurs. Usually this occurs instead of typical error handling, but `whileIgnoringUnknownItem` can be false when this is set, allowing for closure to be executed in addition to typical error handling.
