# MagicCloud

**Magic Cloud** is a **Swift (iOS) Framework** that makes using **CloudKit** simple and easy.

Any data types that need to be saved as database records conform to the **MCRecordable** prototype. The generic **MCReceiver** classes maintain a local repository for your app to access, and mirrors that to **CloudKit's** databases for you.

Default setup covers error handling, subscriptions, account changes and more. Can be configured / customized for optimized performance, or just use as is.
