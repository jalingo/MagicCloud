# MagicCloud

**Magic Cloud** is a **Swift (iOS) Framework** that makes using **CloudKit** simple and easy.

Just conform any data types that need to be saved as database records to the **MCRecordable** prototype. Then the generic **MCReceiver** classes can maintain a local repository for your app to access, and mirror that to **CloudKit's** databases in the background.

Default setup covers _error handling, subscriptions, account changes and more_. Can be configured / customized for optimized performance, or just use as is. Check out the **Quick Start Guide** to get started with less than 15 lines of code!
